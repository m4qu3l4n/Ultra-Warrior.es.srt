Space defense system built to protect our world was accidentally triggered

19
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,040
And often follow Millions more died to survive with a curse

00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,040
Disease chaos and violence became the leaders of the new world those with well

21
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,040
Usually landowners able to grow food formed new cities cities run by military

22
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:12,040
Bohemians pimps and sexual Outlaws open captioning

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,040
Innocence

24
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:24,040
We were forced into the hotch radioactive deserts created by the bombs

25
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:30,040
Colonies was found some of them peaceful happy and content

26
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,040

Fighting like Savages

28
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,040
Eventually feudal governments were formed

29
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,040
Longest bands of roving criminals using weapons and Machinery from the late 20th century

30
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,040


31
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,040
Spiritual group of genetically deformed Nomads trying to live in peace with what was left of all

The rest of our lives

35
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:30,040
Most of the hard labor we worked in that mine

36
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,040
Digging up minerals sold to the outside it was an outsider who came to us one day

37
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,040
An outsider who had no idea that he would change history and freedom UTSA

Those bastards are charging us whatever they want for the zirconium and that ain't good

63
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,040
The reports today in more border skirmishes with the rebel insurgents

64
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,040
An enemy ship probably no suicide missions to cross over the neutral zone

65

No survivors the loss of elliottville insurgents are now in control

72
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,040

Open up a few scientists

144
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,580
The mini-subs just moments before the lab collapsed majority weren't so lucky

145
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:19,580
Buried alive the mines were also sealed probably forever

146
